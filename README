This is the Ruby Really Dumb Graph Library -- a very simple library extending
Ruby to provide best path computation via Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford and "Disjoint
Dijstra" -- repeated execution of Dijkstra's algorithm with path removal to
provide multiple best paths through a graph.

See examples/* for a sample use.

TODO: Floyd-Warshall is currently broken; sorry.
TODO: this documentation is really poor.
TODO: examples are ... lacking.
